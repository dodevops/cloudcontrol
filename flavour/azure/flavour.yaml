description: |
    Can be used to connect to infrastructure in the Azure cloud. Because we're using a container,
    a device login will happen, requiring the user to go to a website, enter a code and login.
    This only happens once during initialization phase.
configuration:
    - "Environment AZ_SUBSCRIPTION: The Azure subscription to use in this container"
