description: |
    Can be used to connect to infrastructure in the Azure cloud. Because we're using a container,
    a device login will happen, requiring the user to go to a website, enter a code and login.
    
    The azure login tokens usually expire after some time. You can run the `azure-relogin` script
    (located in ~/bin, thus available without path) to re-execute the same login commands as the 
    initialization process does.
configuration:
    - "Environment AZ_SUBSCRIPTION: The Azure subscription to use in this container (deprecated)"
    - "Environment ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID: The Azure subscription to use in this container"
    - "Environment AZ_TENANTID: The Azure tenant id to log into (optional, deprecated)"
    - "Environment ARM_TENANT_ID: The Azure tenant id to log into (optional)"
    - "Environment AZ_USE_ARM_SPI: Uses the environment variables ARM_CLIENT_ID and ARM_CLIENT_SECRET for service principal auth [false]"
platforms:
    - linux/amd64
    - linux/arm64
