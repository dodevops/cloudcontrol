title: "![Docker Image Version (latest semver)](https://img.shields.io/docker/v/dodevops/cloudcontrol-aws?sort=semver) [AWS](https://hub.docker.com/r/dodevops/cloudcontrol-aws) (based on [amazon/aws-cli](https://hub.docker.com/r/amazon/aws-cli))"
description: |
    Can be used to connect to infrastructure in the AWS cloud. Also see [the AWS CLI documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html) for more configuration options.
    If you have activated MFA, set AWS_MFA_ARN to the ARN of your MFA device so CloudControl will ask you
    for your code.
    To start a new session in the CloudControl context, run `source createSession.bash <token>` or
    `source createSession.fish <token>` (depending on your selected shell) afterwards
configuration:
    - "Environment AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: Specifies an AWS access key associated with an IAM user or role"
    - "Environment AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: Specifies the secret key associated with the access key. This is essentially the password for the access key"
    - "Environment AWS_DEFAULT_REGION: Specifies the AWS Region to send the request to"
    - "Environment AWS_MFA_ARN: ARN of the MFA device to use to log in"
