    #### Note about logins when using the "kubernetes" feature
    
    The kubernetes login tokens usually expire after a few hours already. You can run the &#x60;relogin&#x60; script (located in ~/bin, thus
    available without path) to re-execute the same login commands as the initialization process does.
