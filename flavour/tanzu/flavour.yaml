    #### Note about logins when using the _"kubernetes"_ feature
    
    The kubernetes login tokens usually expire after a few hours already. You can run the `k8s-relogin` script
    (located in ~/bin, thus available without path) to re-execute the same login commands as the initialization process
    does.
platforms:
    - linux/amd64
