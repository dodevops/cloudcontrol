    - |
        Add a volume mount to the `volumes:` section of docker compose like this:
             (...)
             volumes:
                 - "<Path to directory with CA .pem files>:/certificates"
    - |
        Volume-target /certificates: Target directory for certificates. If something different than /certificates is used, environment 
        CERTIFICATES_PATH needs to be set to this path
    - |
        Environment CERTIFICATES_PATH: The container path to the volume mount that holds trusted certificate authorities as .pem files 
        (optional). Defaults to `/certificates`. If something different than the default is used, the volume-target needs to be adapted to 
        the same directory
