title: "kc Quick Kubernetes Context switch"
description: |
    Installs [kc](https://github.com/dodevops/cloudcontrol/blob/master/feature/kc/kc.sh), a quick context switcher for kubernetes.
deprecation: |
    The `kc` feature will be deprecated in one of the next major CloudControl versions. As an alternative, configure
    the `krew` feature and use the cs plugin:
    ```
    - USE_krew=yes
    - KREW_VERSION=<current version of krew>
    - KREW_PLUGINS=cs
    ```
    
    To make the transition as easy as possible, you can also configure the `run` feature and set an alias to 
    `kubectl cs`:
    
    ```
    - USE_run=yes
    - RUN_COMMANDS="alias kc='kubectl cs'"
    ```
    
    See [https://github.com/dodevops/kc](the kc website) for details.
